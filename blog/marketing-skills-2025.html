    <h1>Top Digital Marketing Skills You Need to Succeed Online in 2025</h1>
    <p class="article-intro">
      The online world is evolving fast — and the businesses that grow the fastest are the ones 
      that master modern digital marketing skills. Whether you're a solopreneur, content creator, 
      or small business owner, the skills below will give you a powerful competitive advantage in 2025.
    </p>

    <h2>1. AI-Powered Content Creation</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence now plays a major role in digital marketing. From idea generation 
      to video editing and automation, AI tools help creators produce more content in less time.
      In 2025, marketers who understand how to prompt AI systems, customize results, and maintain 
      an authentic human touch will dominate their niche.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Social Media Strategy & Short-Form Video</h2>
    <p>
      Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts continue to shape online attention.
      Short-form video is the most effective way to grow organically. Understanding hooks, storytelling,
      and audience psychology is essential for standing out.
    </p>

    <h2>3. SEO & Organic Growth</    h2>
    <p>
      Search engines are still one of the most powerful traffic sources. Knowing how to optimize 
      your website, write keyword-focused content, and structure pages for Google’s new AI-enhanced 
      search results can dramatically increase visibility.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Analytics & Performance Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Successful marketers never guess — they measure. Tools like Google Analytics, search console, 
      and ad dashboards help you understand what content performs best, where people drop off, 
      and how to improve conversions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Paid Ads (Google Ads & Meta Ads)</h2>
    <p>
      Paid advertising has become more automated, but still requires strategy. Mastering campaign 
      structure, audience targeting, retargeting, creative testing, and budgeting allows businesses 
      to scale faster and more predictably.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Email Marketing & Automation</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the rise of social media, email remains one of the highest-ROI marketing channels.
      Learning how to build automated email sequences, nurture leads, and segment your audience 
      helps turn subscribers into loyal customers.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Digital marketing in 2025 is all about adaptability. If you consistently learn, experiment, 
      and make use of modern tools — especially AI — you’ll stay ahead of competitors and build 
      a resilient online business.
