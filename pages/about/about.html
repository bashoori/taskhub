    <!-- WHY AI-FIRST -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Why AI-First?</h2>

      <p class="text-base max-700 center">
        Online businesses rely on repetitive tasks: content rewriting, page tweaks, analytics checks,
        decision-making and analysis across scattered data sources.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base max-700 center">
        Bita Digital Hub is being developed as an <strong>AI-first platform</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li class="feature-card">Automating repetitive workflows instead of just accelerating them.</li>
        <li class="feature-card">Improving content quality and consistency across your online presence.</li>
        <li class="feature-card">Turning scattered metrics into simple, actionable business signals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-base max-700 center">
        The goal is not to replace the entrepreneur — it’s to amplify them.

    <!-- FOUNDER -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">A Note from the Founder</h2>

      <p class="text-base max-700 center">
        Bita Digital Hub was born from a simple observation: people struggle to start and grow online
        businesses not because they lack talent, but because the tools are overwhelming.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base max-700 center">
        With a background in data engineering, I created this platform to close that gap — building tools
        that create clarity, automate complexity, and support real progress.
      </p>
