        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple: make it possible for anyone, anywhere, to start and grow a real
          online business — without needing a big team, a huge budget, or deep technical skills.

        <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
        <p>
          Bita Digital Hub is evolving into a unified AI-driven platform for online business
          operations. Today, the platform includes a growing set of focused tools, such as:
        </p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>File & content utilities</strong> for creators and online entrepreneurs.</li>
          <li><strong>Website and SEO helpers</strong> that improve visibility and site quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Business & decision tools</strong> that support smarter choices before launching offers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These tools act as the foundation for a more advanced system — an AI-assisted teammate for
          your business.

    <!-- WHY AI-FIRST -->
    <section class="section about-ai">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why AI-First?</h2>
        <p>
          Online businesses run on repetitive tasks: content rewriting, landing page tweaks,
          analytics checks, and decision-making based on scattered data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bita Digital Hub is being developed as an <strong>AI-first platform</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Automating repetitive workflows instead of simply speeding them up.</li>
          <li>Improving content quality and consistency across your online presence.</li>
          <li>Turning scattered metrics into simple, actionable business signals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The goal is not to replace the entrepreneur — it’s to amplify them.
        </p>

    <!-- FOUNDER NOTE -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          Bita Digital Hub was born from a simple observation: many people fail to launch or grow
          online businesses not because of lack of talent, but because the tools are overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in data engineering, I started this platform to close that gap —
          building tools that create clarity, automate complexity, and support real progress.
        </p>
