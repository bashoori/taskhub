## What This Is

Most teams don’t need more charts.  
They need **answers**.

- Understand what changed this week
- See trends without noise
- Know what to do next

Everything is delivered as:
- **Weekly PDF reports**
- **Clean Excel / CSV files**

## What This Is Not

- ❌ Not a BI platform  
- ❌ Not real-time dashboards  
- ❌ Not automated chart spam

This is a **calm, repeatable reporting workflow**.
