      <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        Bita Digital Hub is operated by <strong>Bita Ashoori</strong> (Vancouver, Canada).
        The site provides digital tools, educational content, and optional paid services such as weekly reporting, data cleaning, and automation support.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Acceptance of These Terms</h3>
      <p>
        By using this website, its tools, or requesting services, you agree to these Terms of Service and our
        <a href="/legal/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
        If you do not agree, please do not use the site.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Services and Deliverables</h3>
      <p>
        If you request a service (for example: a weekly report), we will confirm scope, required files, expected delivery format, and timelines in writing (email or message).
        Deliverables may include PDF reports, Excel/CSV files, documentation, or recommendations.
      </p>
      <p class="small muted">
        Notes and recommendations are informational and are not a substitute for professional legal, financial, medical, or compliance advice.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Free Offers (Free Data Check / Free First Report)</h3>
      <p>
        Free offers are limited and may change or end at any time. Unless stated otherwise:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Free offers are limited to one submission per person or business.</li>
        <li>Free work is provided “as-is” and does not include ongoing support.</li>
        <li>Free work may have scope limits (file size, number of rows, number of sources, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Your Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to provide accurate information and to upload or share only files you have the legal right to share.
        You are responsible for reviewing outputs before using them for business decisions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not upload sensitive personal data unless we explicitly ask for it and you are authorized to share it.</li>
        <li>Do not upload illegal content, malicious files, or content you do not own or control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Payments, Refunds, and Billing</h3>
      <p>
        For paid services, pricing and payment terms will be shown on the pricing page or confirmed in writing before work begins.
        Unless required by law, payments are generally non-refundable once work has started.
      </p>
      <p class="small muted">
        If a refund exception applies, it will be evaluated case-by-case based on scope, progress, and delivery status.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Delivery Timelines</h3>
      <p>
        Timelines depend on the complexity and quality of the data provided. If delays occur, we will communicate them as soon as possible.
        Delays caused by missing information, unclear requirements, or inaccessible files may extend delivery time.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>
        Website content (design, text, branding, and original materials) belongs to Bita Digital Hub unless otherwise stated.

      <p>
        Your uploaded data remains yours. Deliverables created for you (reports, cleaned files) may be used by you internally for your business.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        If you share business data, we will treat it as confidential and use it only to provide the requested service.
        We do not sell your data. For more details, see the <a href="/legal/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
